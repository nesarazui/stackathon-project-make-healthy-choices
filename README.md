Make Healthy Choices is a native mobile application that provides you with quick nutritional takeaways of the food item you are craving, and provides you with a suggestion for a healthier alternative within that food category. Being able to easily compare the nutritional value of both food options will help the user make the healthier choice.

This app was built in React-Native (with Expo) and uses the third-party API Nutritionix.
